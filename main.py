Using Pandas and other Python Libraries in order to analyze the 
data of healthcare patients. Need to check patients Blood
Pressure, Heart Rate, and other metrics for healthcare. Should
insert data into a file type that stores users data and 
metadata: e.g. Location, Date, Time, etc. Metadata and data
should be stored for all of the patients and kept as a record. 
This allows for doctors to use the data to loook for trends in 
the region and trends for the patient. If patients are on a "bad"
trend, then their file is instantly sent to the nearest doctor in
the region/area. This program should allow for the doctors to
better serve and find patients with higher risk/need.
